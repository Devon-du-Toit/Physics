__Newton's Law of Gravity__: Every particle attracts any other particle with a gravitational force of magnitude:

![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?F%3DG%5Cfrac%7Bm_%7B1%7Dm_%7B2%7D%7D%7Br%5E%7B2%7D%7D)

Here *m<sub>1</sub>* and *m<sub>2</sub>* are the masses of the particles, *r* the distance between them and *G* the gravitational constant:

![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?G%3D6.67%20%5Ctimes%2010%5E%7B-11%7D%5Cfrac%7BN%5Ccdot%20m%5E%7B2%7D%7D%7Bkg%5E%7B2%7D%7D)

__Shell Theorem__: A uniform spherical shell of matter attracts a particle that is outside the shell as if all the shell's mass were concentrated at its center:

__Principle of superposition__: a net effect is the sum of the individual effects.

__Kepler's Laws__: Consider a body with mass *m* orbiting another body with mass *M* such that m << M, therefore the system's center of mass is located at particle mass M center:

The orbit is described by giving its semimajor axis *a* and its eccentricity *e*, the latter defined so that *ea* is the distance from the center of the ellipse to either focus F or F'.

An eccentricity of zero corresponds to a circle.

__The Law of Areas__: A line that connects a planet to the Sun sweeps out equal areas in the plane of the planet's orbit in equal time intervals; that is, the rate *d*A/*dt* at which it sweeps out area A is constant.

__The Law of periods__: The square of the period of any planet is proportional to the cube of the semimajor axis of its orbit:

__Orbital Period of the Moon__:
-Mass of earth = 5,972 × 10<sup>24</sup> kg

-Mass of the Moon = 7.34767309 × 10<sup>22</sup> kg

-a = 3,844 x 10<sup>8</sup> m

-G = 6.67 x 10<sup>-11</sup> m<sup>3</sup>/kg.s<sup>2</sup>

![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?T%5Capprox%202.36%20%5Ctimes%2010%5E%7B6%7Ds)

or in terms of days:

![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?T%5Capprox%202.36%20%5Ctimes%2010%5E%7B6%7Ds%20%5Ctimes%20%5Cfrac%7B1%20%5C%20hour%7D%7B3600%20s%7D%5Ctimes%20%5Cfrac%7B1%20%5C%20day%7D%7B24%20hours%7D)

thus:
